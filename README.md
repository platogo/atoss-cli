## Usage

To log time for the current day from 9:30 to 18:00:

```bash
atoss-cli log -s 9:30 -e 18:00
```

You can also specify a day code (e.g. `wh` for a WFH day):

```bash
atoss-cli log -c wh -e "17:30"
```

If you are unsure about available day codes, you can always check ATOSS manually.

To view the full list of options, call `atoss-cli -h`

### Prerequisite

Create a text file named `.atoss` in your home directory (e.g. `~/.atoss`).

The file should be written in [EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) with the following content:

```edn
{:username "1234567", :password "blablabla"}
```

To view your time logged for the current month, you can use `atoss-cli view`:

```bash
atoss-cli view

Logging into ATOSS with user:  1234567

Month overview:

02.09 |  Do |    - | VGZ |  V |     |       |   |       |   |  8:00 |  0:18 |
03.09 |  Fr |    - | VGZ |  V |     |       |   |       |   |  8:00 |  0:18 |
04.09 |  Sa |    - |  // |    |     |       |   |       |   |       |       |
05.09 |  So |    - |  // |    |     |       |   |       |   |       |       |
```

### Requirements

- `Java Runtime Environment` (at least version 8), I recommend using [Jabba](https://github.com/shyiko/jabba) or Homebrew
- Up to date `chromedriver`. Download it manually from the [official page](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) for your operating system, or install it using your package manager
- Google Chrome (up to date) or Chromium

If you are on macOS, this is as easy as `brew install chromedriver openjdk`

### Installation

Clone this repository and run [install.sh](./install.sh).

If you did not build the uberjar locally, you must have the [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com) installed.

Make sure you are either in the office network or connected to the `banana` VPN.

### Updating

Simply run `./install.sh` again, and the latest release should be installed automatically.

## Development

For **development**, you will need:

- [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started)
- [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org)

I strongly recommend using a combination of Emacs, [Clojure-LSP](https://clojure-lsp.io) and [CIDER](https://docs.cider.mx/cider/index.html).

Fetch deps with `lein deps`

Compile the project with `lein compile`

Run using `lein run` or with an interactive REPL: `lein repl`

Run all tests using `lein test`

### Build

Simply run

```bash

lein uberjar

```

This will build a fully self-contained JAR, ready to be run anywhere.

## Roadmap

  - [x] Add action to view logged time
  - [x] Improve help menu
  - [ ] Build native binary with [GraalVM Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/)
  - [ ] Automated time sheet export and upload for submission

## Troubleshooting

### Chromedriver does not start

This is a fairly common issue due to the security model of macOS. It is likely that after an update of `chromedriver`, it needs to be explicitly granted permissions again.

After it tries to launch, make sure to press `Allow` in `System Preferences > Security & Privacy`

### View command fails

This is an issue with ATOSS remembering the time range you have selected in Monthly Overview.

If you run `atoss-cli view`, the day range should match the current month. This will be fixed in a future update.
