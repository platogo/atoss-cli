# About

A Clojure CLI tool designed to interact with ATOSS. 

## Usage

### Prerequisite

Create a text file named `.atoss` in your home directory (e.g. `~/.atoss`).

The file should be written in [EDN](https://github.com/edn-format/edn) with the following content:

```edn
{:username "1234567", :password "blablabla"}
```

```bash
atoss-cli -s "9:15" -e "16:45" -d "16.09.2021"

ATOSS CLI by Platogo Interactive Entertainment Gmbh.
  -d, --date DATE        17.09.2021  Date in the format DD.MM.YYYY, by default current date.
  -c, --day-code CODE    nil         Valid ATOSS day code (e.g. wh for WFH) can also be left blank.
  -s, --start-time TIME  9:00        Work start time in the format HH:MM
  -e, --end-time TIME    17:00       Work end time in the format HH:MM
  -v                                 Verbosity level
  -h, --help
```

For example, if you were working from home today from `9:00` to `17:30`:

```bash
atoss-cli -c wh -e "17:30"
```

If you are unsure about available day codes, you can always check ATOSS manually.

You can always view the available arguments by typing

```bash
atoss-cli --help
```

### Requirements

- `Java Runtime Environment` (at least version 8), I recommend using [Jabba](https://github.com/shyiko/jabba)
- Up to date `chromedriver` and Google Chrome. Download it manually from the [official page](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) for your operating system, or install it using your package manager

For development, you will need:

- [Clojure](https://clojure.org/guides/getting_started)
- [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org)

I strongly recommend using a combination of Emacs, [Clojure-LSP](https://clojure-lsp.io) and [CIDER](https://docs.cider.mx/cider/index.html).

Fetch deps with `lein deps`

Compile the project with `lein compile`

Run using `lein run` or with an interactive REPL: `lein repl`

Run all tests using `lein test`

### Installation

Clone this repository and run [install.sh](./install.sh).

If you did not build the uberjar locally, you must have the [Github CLI](https://cli.github.com) installed.

Make sure you are either in the office network or connected to the `banana` VPN.

### Build

Simply run

```bash

lein uberjar

```

This will build a fully self-contained JAR, ready to be run anywhere.

## Roadmap

  - [ ] Add action to view logged time
  - [ ] Improve help menu
  - [ ] Build native binary with [GraalVM Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/)
  - [ ] Automated time sheet export and upload for submission
