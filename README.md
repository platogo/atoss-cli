## Usage

To log time for the current day from `9:30` to `18:00`:

```bash
atoss-cli log -s 9:30 -e 18:00
```

You can also specify a day code (e.g. `wh` for a Work From Home (WFH) day):

```bash
atoss-cli log -c wh -e "17:30"
```

If you have a CSV file with your time entries, you can pass that as input too:

```bash
atoss-cli log -f stunden.csv
```

The file must be in the following format:

```csv
date,start,end,code
```

For example:

```csv
25.10.2023,10:00,18:45,wh
```

The code can be optional, just make sure you have the correct number of columns.

If you are unsure about available day codes, you can always check ATOSS manually.

To view the full list of options, call `atoss-cli -h`

### Requirements

- `Java Runtime Environment` (at least version 8), I recommend using [Jabba](https://github.com/shyiko/jabba) or Homebrew (`brew install openjdk`)
- Up to date `chromedriver`. Download it manually from the [official page](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) for your operating system, or install it using your package manager (e.g. `brew install chromedriver`)
- Google Chrome (up to date) or Chromium

If you are on macOS, this is as easy as `brew install chromedriver openjdk`

### Installation

#### Homebrew

Simply run `brew install platogo/tap/atoss-cli`

#### Automatic

Clone this repository and run [install.sh](./install.sh).

#### Manually

Download the latest release JAR from [Release](https://github.com/platogo/atoss-cli/releases) and save it somewhere. Then simply run it:

```bash
java -jar atoss-cli-standalone.jar -h
```

### Configuration

```bash
atoss-cli config init
atoss-cli config set username <your atoss username>
atoss-cli config set password <your atoss password>
```

Optionally, you can also set a custom Atoss URL:

```bash
atoss-cli config set url http://ases.custom.com
```

This will create a text file named `.atoss` in your home directory (e.g. `~/.atoss` on *nix).

### Updating

Simply run `./install.sh` again, and the latest release should be installed automatically.

## Development

Check out [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md)

## Roadmap

  - [x] Improve help menu
  - [ ] Build native binary with [GraalVM Native Image](https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/)
  - [ ] Automated time sheet export and upload for submission
  - [ ] Multiple time pairs for a single day support
  - [x] Windows support
  
## Troubleshooting

### View command fails

This is an issue with ATOSS remembering the time range you have selected in Monthly Overview.

If you run `atoss-cli view`, the day range should match the current month. This will be fixed in a future update.
